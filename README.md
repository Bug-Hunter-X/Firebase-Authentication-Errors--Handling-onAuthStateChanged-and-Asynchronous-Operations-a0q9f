# Firebase Authentication Error Handling
This repository demonstrates common errors encountered when using Firebase Authentication and provides solutions.

The `onAuthStateChanged` listener is asynchronous. Attempting to access user data like `currentUser.uid` before the authentication state is determined will often result in errors because `currentUser` might be null.
